<h1 style="font-type:sans-serif">Funfact about Me!</h1>
<p style="background-color:#EAEDED">People can call me dina or dee but i personally love it when people call me dina. i was born in Alor Setar Kedah. and i am a part five student of information management student in Uitm Kedah. I am the first born in the family. photography has always been one of my favourite hobbies. One of the reasons why I enjoy photography is because it gives me a healthy way to deal with stress. Photography allows introverts like me to express and bring out the beauty in front of us. When I take a picture with my camera, I can see the world in a whole new different light. When I go to new places, I would usually take pictures on my phone and straight away edit them to post them on my instagram. the person i admired the most is. i love exploring new cafes as the atmosphere of the cafe is designed to make you want to stay a little longer.</p>
